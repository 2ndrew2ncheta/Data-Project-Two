<p>As New Yorkers go back to work, so do government inspectors. The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection, which regulates everything from price tags to horse-drawn buggies, has released the latest inspection results for NYC’s 51,000 businesses. Those results indicate that 44% of completed inspections in 2022 ended with a warning, violation, or other disciplinary action, up from 34% last year.</p> 

<p>Most first-time violations can be "cured" by fixing the offense within 30 days, according to the city's <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/dca/businesses/cure-dca-violation.page">website</a>. In rare cases, a violation may end with the confiscation of a business' equipment or license.</p>

<p>One explanation is that the government is simply making up for time lost during the pandemic, according to Michael Brady, CEO of the Third Avenue Business Improvement District in the Bronx. </p> 

<p>“Eventually the city has to restart it’s purpose, and that’s to keep people safe,” Brady said. “You’re restarting the engine. That includes putting more inspectors out, coming in with a firm hand. There is an expected uptick in fines and inspection visits.”</p>

<p>But there is another explanation as well. “The city and the state and the Federal government are looking down the road and they’re finding a huge budget gap,” Brady said. “The government will find ways to fill that budget gap. I think fines and things like that are a piece of it.”</p>
